# DockManager Accessibility

The DockManager is accessible by screen readers and provides WAI-ARIA, Section 508, WCAG 2.2, and keyboard support.

For more information, refer to [Accessibility in Kendo UI for jQuery]({% slug overview_accessibility_support_kendoui %}).

Out of the box, the Kendo UI for jQuery DockManager provides extensive accessibility support and enables users with disabilities to acquire complete control over its features.

The DockManager is compliant with the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2 AA](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/) standards and [Section 508](https://www.section508.gov/) requirements, follows the [Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications (WAI-ARIA)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/) best practices for implementing the [keyboard navigation](#keyboard-navigation) for its `component` role, provides options for managing its focus and is tested against the most popular screen readers.

## WAI-ARIA

This section lists the selectors, attributes, and behavior patterns supported by the component and its composite elements, if any.

The DockManager component consists of multiple inner panes, each containing tools, tabs, and content that can be resized, rearranged, and interacted with.

| Selector | Attribute | Usage |
| -------- | --------- | ----- |
| `.k-dock-manager` | `role=application` | Indicates that the DockManager has its own keyboard navigation implemented. |
|  | `aria-live=polite` | Defines dynamic content changes within the DockManager container that need to be announced by screen readers. |
| `.k-dock-navigator` | `aria-hidden=true` | The navigator needs to be hidden from the readers as it appears only on drag. |

The Toolbar in the DockManager element of the component should implement the specification for the **Toolbar** component.
